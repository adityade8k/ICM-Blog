I was introduced to p5.js by an Irish Artist, Garett Lynch IRL in my sophomore year. Srishti is an art school and when I started I was very intimidated by all the talented artists around me. It was due to p5.js that I was able to find my artistic voice and express freely.`

After graduating I had a chance to teach at my college and I have since developed my very own p5.js curriculum that is not too different from the content we are doing in this class. I have also taught this curriculum in BITS Design School, Mumbai.`

While this medium has been life-changing for me, I have found that I have struggled to have that same effect on my students (consistently). Teaching in my opinion is a performance art and only by studying other great performers’ performances can I learn to teach better.`

Instead I defined a data structure that lets me specify the properties of a shape and a function to render those shapes. I then initialized all elements into a list and rendered them (I learnt this trick from the coding train).`
